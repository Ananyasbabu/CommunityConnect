# üåê CommunityConnect ‚Äì Local Help & Emergency Portal

## üìå Project Overview
**CommunityConnect** is a web-based platform designed to connect people during emergencies and local needs.
In situations like **floods, accidents, fires, blood donation, lost pets, or charity drives**, information is often scattered across WhatsApp groups or social media, where it gets lost or reaches the wrong audience.

This portal provides a **centralized and organized platform** where users can post **help requests** or **offers of help**, search nearby posts, and register as volunteers. The system ensures real-time, location-based, and category-wise access to information, thereby enhancing community-driven emergency response.

## üéØ Objectives
- Create a **centralized portal** for emergency and local help.
- Allow users to **post help requests** or **offer assistance** with category & location tagging.
